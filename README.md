# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction – Machine Learning Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning techniques.  
The model is trained on historical passenger data and learns patterns from features such as age, gender, passenger class, fare, and embarkation port.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze the Titanic dataset
- Clean and preprocess data
- Perform feature engineering
- Train machine learning models
- Evaluate model performance
- Predict survival outcomes
